# prospect-salesforce

A small project where the query is carried out in the API Receita Federal (Brazil) which, informing the CNPJ, will search for the information of this company and will create a lead if the query is successful. In the future, it will be created to also create a task for the user who performed the consultation and conversion of a Lead to an Account.

In this development I tried to consider the criterion that each class and method should have its unique responsibility as well as the names of variables, classes and methods following the pattern of capital and lowercase letters for each situation.

Also used clean code pattern, where it must be understandable by any level of programmer you are, that is, you will be able to understand exactly what each class and method is doing without the need for large comments in code, making it beautiful and fragrant. haha
